# 👋 Hi there! I'm Nikolaï 

Hello there ! 
I'm a **Software Engineering student** with a love for building things that work well and fast — from the bare metal to the cloud 🚀.

## 🛠️ Language Arsenal

Currently obsessed with the following languages (but I dabble in oh so much more...)
- 🦀 **Rust** (carcinisation is inevitable)
- 🐧 **C** (old and reliable)
- 💡 **Haskell** (functional programming feels so good)
- 🦫 **Go** (simple, fast, and great for distributed systems)

## 🎓 What I'm Learning

Currently, I'm diving deep into:
- ⚡ **Embedded Development** (anything where failure can be smelled ⚡🔥)
- 🌐 **Distributed Systems** (being cheap about servers, really)
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity** (doing funny things with other people's computers)

I'm still happy to learn and talk about pretty much anything, as long as it's challenging \
If spending a lot of time tinkering with complicated stuff sounds like fun to you, feel free to reach out !
